# 1. QUESTION ANALYSIS:
#    - Thoroughly analyze the provided job description

# 2. QUESTION GENERATION STRATEGY:
#    a) Difficulty Level Calibration:

#         * Basic: Fundamental knowledge, straightforward application
#         * Intermediate: Deeper understanding, moderate complexity
#         * Advanced: Complex scenarios, strategic thinking

#    b) Question Traits Implementation:
#       Focus on traits: {question_traits}
#       - Embed these traits into question design
#       - Ensure questions test specified capabilities
